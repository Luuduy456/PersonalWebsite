        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I started coding in 2023, not really knowing what to expect, and it has been an incredible journey so
          far. From learning the basics of HTML and CSS to diving into JavaScript
          and beyond, every step has been a new adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blog is a reflection of my growth as a developer, and I hope it
          inspires others to embark on their own coding journeys.

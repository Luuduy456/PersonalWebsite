                <h3>Project 1: The first touch with HTML and CSS</h3>
                <p>This project was my initial exploration into web development, focusing on the basics of HTML and CSS.
                    <br />
                   It includes a simple layout with a header, footer, and main content area.
                   It very basic but it was a great start to my coding journey. It was great but for it kind of hard to
                   understand at first. If you are new to coding, I highly recommend starting with this project. especially
                   if you are interested in web development or want a smooth starting with code.
                </p>
                <p>I will show you my code below:</p>

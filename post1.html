            <p>In this post, I will talk about my journey as a self-taught coder and the challenges I faced along the way.
                I will also share some tips and resources that helped me stay motivated and keep learning.
            From overcoming obstacles to celebrating small wins, I hope to provide insights that resonate with fellow learners.
        if you guys want to see more of my digital art, you can check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/luuhoangduy_/">Instagram</a> where I post my latest creations.
            Also if you guys asking about the "Comment function" the answer is simple: I don't have one yet, but I'm looking into it!
        I really hope that you guys give me some time to implement it in the future!</p>
